R base graphics
----------------

The examples on this site cover so-called R base graphics, as opposed to diagram frameworks which are based on packages like [`ggplot2`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2) or [`lattice`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=lattice).

Further examples

See these resources for `ggplot2` examples:

 - [Cookbook for R: `ggplot2` diagrams](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
 - [Learning R blog: `ggplot2` tag](http://learnr.wordpress.com/tag/ggplot2/)

Many custom diagrams of various types can be found in the [R graph gallery](http://gallery.r-enthusiasts.com/).
