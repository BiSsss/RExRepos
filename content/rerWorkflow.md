 - R package [`markdown`](http://cran.r-project.org/package=markdown): convert markdown to html
 - Integrated development environment [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.org/): great support for knitr and markdown
 - [A good introduction](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.de/2012/05/getting-started-with-r-markdown-knitr.html) from Jeromy Anglim
